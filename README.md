## Introduction

Our game is a two-player game based on a flash game *Bowman*. 
Normally, the game-play is that players drag the mouse to pull back the bow and shoot, then a camera will follow the arrow to check whether you have shot the target.
We've transformed the game into a space-themed version by introducing a gravity engine to calculate gravity between planets as well as special functions like pathfinder to enhance the original game-play.

## Requirements

### Ideation Process

We have two game ideas at the beginning proposed by two of our team members, which are the two-player bowman game with camera movement and gravity physical engine, and a RPG-like two-player game with storyline, interactions with the envrionment and boss fights.
We use paper prototype to mock the outline of these two game's workflow. Soon after the mock and dicussions, we collectively decided to pursue the *Bowman* game due to its more specified twists and requirements, and its solid gameplay foundation.

### User Storeies

>"As a player, I want to have personalize choices at the start of the game so that I can choose the game's difficulty based on my preferences."
>"As a player, I want to gain resources through some special behviours in the game, and these resources can be able to trade for special skills, so it is bit more fun."
>"As a player, I want to know the force and the direction of my arrow, so I need a sign to acknowledge that."
>"As a second player, I want to be able to play the game with my friends, so that I can have fun with two players other than play against the computer."
>"As a player, I want to have cases or tutorial examples telling me some of special designs of the game."
>"As a player, I want a skip function to skip the animation, so that I can get the resultÂ immediately."
>"As a marker for this project, I want to see groups create engaging and well made games, with a strong process of development that utilises the techniques taught in this module."
>"As a future group for this module, we want to see good examples of games which will inspire us when creating our own game."

### Early Stage Design

We sat down and brainstormed about additional content ideas beyond the original concept, as well as any technical requirements that might arise during the early stages of game development. Then we discussed about what to implement and used Kanban Board to assign tasks and track the progress of our work and timely updated them into our chat group.

#### Core Gameplay

The core game flow will be, the game starts and players can choose from whether this is "VS Computer" mode or "VS Human" mode, and self-defined the rounds and HP that each player should have.
Then the players click and drag mouse to control the bow's tension and direction, and then release the mouse to fire. The camera will then focus on the arrow until it shot on any bounding shape.
Additionally, we want to introduced a points collection system to raise a shop system where players can buy some one-time skills. the gravity works was also being discussed, there are proposals like whether to do a half and half screen where one side has negative gravity or use the escape velocity formula for planets, we choosed the latter eventually.

#### Obstacles

The first obstabcle that might occur is the gravity calculation methods that involes physics. So we should take a look into the escape velocity formula for planets, luckily we only have two planets and one object to model.
Another barrier is the camera zoom in or zoom out function. The core design is that the other player's position is invisible in this player's turn. So the camera should keep this player at the center of the screen and move follows the arrow after firing.
[AI player???]

#### TODO list

After putting all the designs and concerns on the table, we wrote a TODO list to guide the step-by-step development of the whole game.
The highest priority tasks include implementing the physics engine to calculate gravity and 2D bounding collision detection, and the camera movements as well. Then we will add the shop system, the HP detection, and any other things.

# Game idea
## Game idea 1 - 2 player cooperative game

It is a game involving both puzzles and actions. Similar to this part "Ice and Fire" of "It takes two" gameplay, but make it 2D.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaLqVvRAuSA
* The main plot is: the mage twins receive a quest to find the kingdom's hidden treasure, a task that requires them to traverse through fields imbued with fire and ice. It the story can be told by giving the players a few slides at first (kinda like the start of HELLTAKER).
  ![](assets/game-idea-imgs/game-idea-1-1.png)
* the first room should be a tutorial room, with simple instructions and punching bags for players to try how to manipulate.
* the second big room can be a field with environmental interaction(the players can figure out puzzles together and use their specialty to solve it) and of course there are some Minion to beat.
  ![](assets/game-idea-imgs/game-idea-1-2.png)
* the third room can be "BOSS ROOM", the twins finally get to the treasure, but first they are going to beat a giant dragon first...(by the way, The BOSS can switch between ice and fire attributes)

### The twist
It is a game with interations with the environment(puzzles) and BOSS fight. especially as the mage twins finally approach the treasure in the 'BOSS ROOM,' they discover that the giant dragon guarding it has the ability to not only switch between ice and fire attributes but also to merge these elements

### Challenges
### Challenge 1: Environmental Interaction
Make the ice and fire elements interact with the environment differently. For instance, in the fiery domain, players might need to utilize flames to propel mechanisms, while in the icy realm, they may have to freeze bodies of water or use ice to create pathways.

### Challenge 2: Multiple players
We aim to encourage players to collaborate with each other and leverage the unique strengths of their characters.

### Challenge 3: Actions
So...there should be "Attack Range Detection" and he teams should come up with a method to calculate the mathematical relation among Boss HP, attack damage and attributes.
And after being attaked, the players' HP should also be calculated.


**To be discussed...**

## Game Idea 2 - 2 player versus game

* A classic turn based 2d game, in the style of old flash games such as Raft Wars, Bowman, Fleabag and Mutt, etc.

### Twist idea
* Set in space, with each player located on a different planet. This would mean that each player would have to account for gravity and other planets when they shoot!

### Challenges
  * **Camera movement**; in bowman and raft wars, the camera moves with the projectile so the shooting player cannot see exactly where they need to hit
  * **Gravity engine**; Gravity mechanics would need to be implemented for this idea (if it is set in space) and the balance between realism and difficulty would need to be found
  * **AI enemy**; allowing a single player to fight against a computer would add more depth to this game, and it would pose a challenge to create the computer player.

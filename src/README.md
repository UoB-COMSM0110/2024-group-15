# bowman prototype


## notes

* `resetMatrix` is used when drawing GUI (something which you don't want to be affected by the camera)

* `pushStyle/pullStyle` is useful when you want an object to have a different style, but don't want to affect any other objects

* I don't know if you guys have come across HashMaps/Dictionaries, but they are basically keypairs and are quite useful and are used in the App class

# Decription
**2-player cooperate games**

It is a game involving both puzzles and actions. Similar to this part "Ice and Fire" of "It takes two" gameplay, but make it 2D.

* The main plot is: the mage twins receive a quest to find the kingdom's hidden treasure, a task that requires them to traverse through fields imbued with fire and ice. It the story can be told by giving the players a few slides at first (kinda like the start of HELLTAKER).

* the first room should be a tutorial room, with simple instructions and punching bags for players to try how to manipulate.
* the second big room can be a field with environmental interaction(the players can figure out puzzles together and use their specialty to solve it) and of course there are some Minion to beat.

* the third room can be "BOSS ROOM", the twins finally get to the treasure, but first they are going to beat a giant dragon first...(by the way, The BOSS can switch between ice and fire attributes)

# The twist
It is a game with interations with the environment(puzzles) and BOSS fight. especially as the mage twins finally approach the treasure in the 'BOSS ROOM,' they discover that the giant dragon guarding it has the ability to not only switch between ice and fire attributes but also to merge these elements 

# Challenges
## Challenge 1: Environmental Interaction
Make the ice and fire elements interact with the environment differently. For instance, in the fiery domain, players might need to utilize flames to propel mechanisms, while in the icy realm, they may have to freeze bodies of water or use ice to create pathways.

## Challenge 2: Multiple players
We aim to encourage players to collaborate with each other and leverage the unique strengths of their characters. 

## Challenge 3: Actions
So...there should be "Attack Range Detection" and he teams should come up with a method to calculate the mathematical relation among Boss HP, attack damage and attributes.
And after being attaked, the players' HP should also be calculated.


**To be discussed...**

Should we make the game undertale-like or the mario-like
